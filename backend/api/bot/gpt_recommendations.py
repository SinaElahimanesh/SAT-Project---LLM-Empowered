                          could provide in response. Each suggestion should be brief, contextually relevant, and formatted clearly as:
                          suggestion1 / suggestion2 / suggestion3.
                          Ensure that the responses are thoughtful, aligned with the conversation's context, and maintain a neutral tone.
                                       The writing style of suggestions should be informal.
